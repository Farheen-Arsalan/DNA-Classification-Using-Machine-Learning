# DNA Classification Using Machine Learning

In this project, we will explore the world of bioinformatics by using Markov models, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, support vector machines, and other common classifiers to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.
